            In this chapter author shares a story of a man who sells different color balloons at fair, whenever his business used to go down, in order to tackle that situation he used to fly one balloon in the air, so that when children see that balloon in air, they feel like buying it, with this technique his sales again used to go up, one day when he was selling his balloon one boy came near him and asked him, “If you release a black balloon, would that also fly.” That balloon seller moved by that boy’s concern, for this, that man replied With empathy, <b>”Son, it is not the colour of the balloon,it is what is inside that makes it go up.”</b>

    	<h2>Chapter 3: The Lion and the Mouse</h2>
    	<p class="quote">
            A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started 
            running up and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the 
            lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat 
            the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set 
            him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday 
            if you save me.” The lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and 
            let him go. <br>

            One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the lion with
            them. They tied him up against a tree. The lion was struggling to
            get out and started to whimper. Soon, the mouse walked past and 
            noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed on the 
            ropes to set the lion free. Both of them.
